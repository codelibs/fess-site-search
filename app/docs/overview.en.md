## What is Fess Site Search?
Fess Site Search (FSS) provides a search feature that integrates [Enterprise Search Server Fess](http://fess.codelibs.org/) into an existing website.
Using tags provided by FSS and JavaScript files, you can display a search box and search result table on your website.
The installation is very easy and you can smoothly migrate from Google Site Search, Google Custom Search or the like.
